# DataCamp Projects Portfolio

This repository contains my DataCamp projects, showcasing hands-on experience with data analysis, visualization, and Python programming. Each project is organized in its own folder and includes the Jupyter notebook, datasets, and any relevant images.

## Project Structure

Each project folder contains:
- `notebook.ipynb` — The main Jupyter notebook with the project work
- `dataset/` — Any datasets used in the project
- `images/` (optional) — Any images linked in the notebook

## Notes
- Projects are organized by topic and complexity.
- Jupyter notebooks are ready to run.
- More detailed descriptions for each project will be added soon.
